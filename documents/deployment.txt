* sample yaml file:
    /yaml/deployment.yaml
* deployment name:
    deployment-cloud


# monitor pods, rs, deployment
    watch -d 'kubectl get pods,rs,deployment -o wide'


# get info about deployment

# delete replicaset
    k delete replicaset.apps <deployment-name>-<hash>
    k delete replicaset.apps deployment-cloud-5fc5956697

    -> This will delete the pod and create a new one with a new hash
    -> Because the deployment is still there and it will create a new replicaset with a new pod

k rollout history deployment deployment-cloud
